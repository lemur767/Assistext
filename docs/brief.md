### **Project Brief: Assistext**

### Executive Summary

Assistext is an all-in-one SMS AI agent that provides a ghost phone number and uses artificial intelligence to automatically answer incoming text messages. The AI is designed to learn and mimic the user's language style and texting habits, providing seamless and authentic communication.

The primary problem Assistext solves is the overwhelming and stressful flood of incoming messages that service professionals, such as escorts or busy businesses with 24/7 support lines, experience after online posts or during peak hours.

The key value proposition is the elimination of stress and prioritization challenges associated with a flooded inbox, allowing users to focus on providing their services rather than managing their messages.

### Problem Statement

Service professionals, particularly escorts and busy businesses with high-volume inbound text messages, currently face significant challenges in managing their communications. After making online posts or during peak business hours, they are inundated with a flood of messages, leading to a state of disorganization and anxiety. The primary pain points are the inability to effectively prioritize responses and the overwhelming stress of a constantly buzzing phone.

The impact of this problem is substantial, resulting in direct financial losses from missed opportunities and potential clients. Furthermore, it contributes to user burnout, anxiety, and a diminished quality of service for their clientele. The constant distraction and mental burden also present a safety concern for professionals like escorts, who need to remain focused and aware of their surroundings.

Currently, there are no known dedicated solutions that effectively address this specific problem. Users are left to manage the influx of messages manually, which is inefficient and unsustainable. The urgency to solve this problem lies in the need to provide these professionals with a tool that not only improves their business efficiency and profitability but also enhances their personal safety and well-being by reducing distractions and stress.

### Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is Assistext, a user-friendly and affordable SMS AI agent. The core of the service is providing users with a "ghost" phone number upon signup, which immediately shields their personal number from spam and unwanted contact. This ghost number is powered by the Signalwire backbone, ensuring a reliable and scalable infrastructure.

The key differentiator for Assistext is its simplicity and focus on a specific, underserved market. While other generic chatbot solutions may exist, Assistext is purpose-built to handle the high-volume, often sensitive, and time-critical nature of messages received by service professionals. Its success will be driven by its ease of setup, intuitive monitoring capabilities, and affordability, making a technically complex solution accessible to non-technical users.

The high-level vision for Assistext is to evolve from an automated messaging agent into a comprehensive communication platform. Future developments include a real-time chat application allowing users to seamlessly take over conversations from their AI bot, manage a client list, and potentially incorporate real-time messaging and video call functionalities for online interactions.

### Technical Considerations

#### Platform Requirements

*   **Target Platforms:** The initial launch will be a web application. Native applications for iOS and Android are planned for future releases.
*   **Browser/OS Support:** The web application should support the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). The future mobile apps will target the newest major versions of iOS and Android.
*   **Performance Requirements:** AI-generated responses must be delivered quickly to ensure a near real-time conversational experience for the end-users. A specific latency target (e.g., under 2 seconds) will be defined during the architecture phase.

#### Technology Preferences

*   **Frontend:** The web application will be built using React and TypeScript, with CSS Modules for styling.
*   **Backend:** The backend will be developed using Python with the Flask framework.
*   **Database:** The primary database will be Supabase, utilizing its PostgreSQL capabilities.
*   **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Development will be done locally. The production environment will consist of three Virtual Private Servers (VPS) within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to host the frontend, backend, and the Large Language Model (LLM) separately. The LLM server will be isolated and only accessible from the backend server to ensure security.
*   **Key Integrations:** The service will heavily rely on the Signalwire API for its core telephony and SMS functionalities.

#### Architecture Considerations

*   **Repository Structure:** The project will use separate repositories for the frontend and backend codebases to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
*   **Service Architecture:** The decision between a monolithic or microservices architecture is yet to be determined and will be a key focus of the architecture design phase.
*   **Integration Requirements:** The application will require integrations with three key third-party services:
    *   **Signalwire:** For all SMS and telephony functionalities.
    *   **Stripe:** For processing payments and subscriptions.
    *   **Ollama:** To serve and interact with the self-hosted Large Language Model.
*   **Security/Compliance:** While there are no specific, known compliance requirements at this stage, the application must be built with standard web application security best practices in mind. This includes data encryption, secure authentication, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10). Given the sensitive nature of the communications, user data privacy and security will be a top priority.

### Constraints & Assumptions

#### Constraints

*   **Budget:** The project will be developed with a strong focus on cost-effectiveness, aiming to be "as cheap as possible". There are existing Signalwire credits available for test accounts, sub-project creation, and purchasing numbers for testing purposes.
*   **Timeline:** There are no specific deadlines or target launch dates at this time.
*   **Resources:** (No constraints identified at this time).
*   **Technical:** (No additional technical constraints identified beyond the technology preferences already stated).

*   The Signalwire and Ollama APIs will meet our performance and reliability needs.
*   There is a large enough market of users with this specific pain point to build a sustainable business.

### Risks & Open Questions

#### Key Risks

*   **Market Adoption Risk:** The target market may not be willing to pay for a solution, or the market may be smaller than anticipated.
*   **Technical Risk:** The AI may not be able to mimic user styles accurately enough, leading to a poor user experience. There could also be unforeseen challenges with the Signalwire or Ollama integrations.
*   **Reputational Risk:** If the AI responds inappropriately, it could damage the user's reputation or business.
*   **Competition Risk:** A larger company could enter the market with a similar, more polished solution.

#### Open Questions

*   How much sample data will be needed to effectively train the AI on a user's unique style?
*   What is the best way to handle situations where the AI is unsure how to respond? (e.g., escalate to the user, send a generic reply, etc.)
