# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: October 9, 2025**

Welcome to Assistext! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website, services, and applications (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 1. Description of Service

Assistext is a service that allows you to automate your SMS and MMS messages using artificial intelligence. Our AI can generate messages on your behalf and, for Pro users, can be trained to mimic your writing style.

## 2. AI-Generated Messages

**By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that messages sent from your account may be generated by an artificial intelligence.** You are responsible for all messages sent from your account, whether they are written by you or generated by our AI.

## 3. Pro User Features

Pro users have the option to allow our AI to learn and mimic their writing style for the purpose of generating more personalized messages. By enabling this feature, you grant us the right to analyze the messages you send to train our AI.

## 4. User Responsibility and Compliance

You are solely responsible for your conduct and for any content that you create, transmit, or display while using the Service. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Service, including but not limited to, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and other laws regarding telemarketing, spam, and unsolicited commercial messages.

You are responsible for obtaining any necessary consent from the recipients of your messages. Assistext is not responsible for your failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations.

## 5. AI Signature

As a convenience, we offer an optional feature that allows you to include a "Sent with AI using Assistext" signature on messages generated by our AI. You can enable or disable this feature in your account settings. The use of this signature does not relieve you of your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

## 6. User Conduct

You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful or prohibited purpose.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Assistext be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not to, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.

## 9. Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page.
