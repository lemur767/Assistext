## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to upload a text file of my past conversations, so that the AI can use it to learn my communication style.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the settings page, **When** they upload a text file, **Then** the system receives and stores the file.
2. **Given** a training file has been uploaded, **When** the AI generates a response, **Then** the content of the training file is included as context in the prompt to the LLM.
3. **Given** the AI has been trained with a user's style, **When** it generates responses, **Then** the responses should qualitatively reflect the style of the uploaded text.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the user uploads a file that is not a text file? The system should reject the file with an error message.
- What happens if the uploaded file is very large? The system will reject files that exceed the 1GB size limit.
- How does the system handle multiple uploaded files? The system will combine the content of all uploaded training files. The AI will then analyze the combined content to formulate rules for its personality, based on message formatting, use of slang, use of abbreviations, general patterns for responses, use of emojis, and tone.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a user interface for users to upload a text file.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
