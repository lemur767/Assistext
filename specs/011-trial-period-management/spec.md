# Feature Specification: Trial Period Management

**Feature Branch**: `011-trial-period-management`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Final  
**Input**: User description: "Trial Period Management, as per Story 3.4 in PRD"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want the system to manage the 14-day trial period for new users, so that users are prompted to subscribe before their trial expires and access is restricted afterward.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user signs up, **When** their account is created, **Then** their trial expiration date (14 days from signup) is recorded.
2. **Given** a user is within their trial period, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** a prominent banner at the top of the page displays the number of days left in their trial and a call to action to subscribe.
3. **Given** a user's trial period is nearing its end, **When** there are 3 days left, **Then** the system sends an email notification to the user.
4. **Given** a user's trial period expires, **When** they have not subscribed, **Then** their access to the service is restricted, and they are prompted to subscribe.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a user subscribes during their trial? The trial should end, the dashboard banner should be removed, and the paid subscription should begin immediately.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST record the trial expiration date (14 days from signup) for each new user.
- **FR-002**: The UI MUST display a prominent, persistent banner at the top of the dashboard showing the number of days remaining in the user's trial period.
- **FR-003**: The trial banner MUST include a clear call to action to subscribe.
- **FR-004**: System MUST send an email notification to the user when their trial period has 3 days remaining.
- **FR-005**: System MUST restrict access to core features (e.g., AI stops responding) if the trial expires and the user has not subscribed.
- **FR-006**: The UI MUST clearly notify the user when their trial has expired and provide a clear call to action to subscribe.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Needs an attribute to store the `trial_expires_at` timestamp.
