---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to see a list of all the conversations my AI agent is having, so that I can monitor the AI's performance and ensure the quality of the interactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is logged in and on the dashboard, **When** they view the conversation list, **Then** it displays a list of conversations, showing the contact number and a snippet of the last message.
2. **Given** a user is viewing the conversation list, **When** they click on a conversation, **Then** a detailed view of all messages in that thread opens.
3. **Given** a user is viewing a detailed conversation, **When** they see messages, **Then** the view clearly distinguishes between incoming messages and AI-generated responses.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if there are no conversations yet? The system should display a clear message indicating no conversations and guide the user on how to initiate one.
- How does the system handle a very large number of conversations? The system will use numbered pages for pagination to ensure performance and usability.
