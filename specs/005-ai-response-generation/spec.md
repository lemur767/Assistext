# Feature Specification: AI Response Generation

**Feature Branch**: `005-ai-response-generation`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Final  
**Input**: User description: "AI Response Generation, as per Story 2.2 in PRD"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a backend developer, I want to integrate with the Ollama LLM to generate a response to an incoming message, so that the AI can formulate a reply.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system has received an incoming message, **When** the AI response generation process is triggered, **Then** the system makes a request to the Ollama LLM server with the message content and conversation history.
2. **Given** the Ollama LLM server processes the request successfully, **When** the system receives the response, **Then** the generated text is parsed and saved to the database.
3. - **Given** the Ollama LLM server returns an error or is unavailable, **When** the system attempts to generate a response, **Then** the error is logged, no message is sent, and the user is notified to intercept the conversation.

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle very long conversation histories? The system will use a summarization technique to condense the conversation history before sending it to the LLM to manage context length.
- What happens if the LLM generates an inappropriate or empty response? The system will validate that the response does not exceed 180 words. No other content filtering will be applied.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST be able to make a request to the Ollama LLM server.
- **FR-002**: The request to the LLM MUST include the incoming message content and relevant conversation history.
- **FR-003**: System MUST be able to receive and parse the generated text response from the LLM.
- **FR-004**: The generated response MUST be saved to the database.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle errors from the Ollama LLM server gracefully.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AI Model**: Represents the Ollama LLM. The system interacts with it via an API.
