# Feature Specification: User Account & Stripe Customer Creation

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-account-stripe`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09 
**Status**: Final  
**Input**: User description: "User Account & Stripe Customer Creation, as per Story 1.2 in PRD"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a new user, I want to sign up for an account using my email and password. Upon successful registration, I expect the system to create a customer profile for me in the payment system so that I am ready for future billing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user is on the signup page, **When** they enter a valid email and password and click "Sign Up", **Then** a new user account is created in the database, a corresponding customer is created in Stripe, and the user is redirected to the dashboard.
2. **Given** a user tries to sign up with an email that already exists, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the system displays an error message "Email already in use" and does not create a new account.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Stripe API is unavailable during signup? The system should handle the error gracefully, not create a partial user account, and inform the user to try again later.
- How does the system handle invalid email formats or weak passwords? The system should provide real-time validation feedback on the signup form.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a user interface for new users to sign up with an email and password.
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that the provided email address is in a valid format.
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce a minimum password complexity of at least 12 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
- **FR-004**: System MUST create a new user record in the database upon successful signup.
- **FR-005**: System MUST make a request to the Stripe API to create a new Customer object after a user account is created.
- **FR-006**: System MUST store the returned Stripe Customer ID and associate it with the user's account.
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent the creation of accounts with duplicate email addresses.
- **FR-008**: System MUST log the user in and redirect them to the dashboard after a successful signup.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a person who has signed up for the service. Key attributes include email, password (hashed), and a reference to their Stripe Customer ID.
- **Stripe Customer**: Represents the user's billing profile within the Stripe payment system. Managed by Stripe, but the ID is stored by our application.
