# Feature Specification: Stripe Payment Integration

**Feature Branch**: `010-stripe-payment-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Final  
**Input**: User description: "Stripe Payment Integration, as per Story 3.3 in PRD"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to be able to securely enter my payment information to pay for my subscription, so that I can continue using the service after my trial ends.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has selected a subscription plan, **When** they proceed to payment, **Then** they are presented with a secure Stripe payment form.
2. **Given** a user enters valid payment information into the Stripe form, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the payment is successfully processed by Stripe.
3. **Given** a successful payment, **When** the system receives confirmation from Stripe, **Then** the user's account is marked as "active" with the selected subscription plan.
4. **Given** a payment failure, **When** the system receives the failure notice from Stripe, **Then** a clear error message is displayed to the user.

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle different payment failure scenarios (e.g., insufficient funds, expired card, fraudulent transaction)? The system should display the appropriate error message provided by Stripe.
- What happens if the user closes the browser or loses connection during the payment process? The system should ensure that no partial subscription is created and the user can retry the payment later.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate with Stripe to handle payments.
- **FR-002**: System MUST present a secure Stripe payment form (e.g., Stripe Elements or Checkout) when a user decides to subscribe.
- **FR-003**: System MUST be able to process a payment via Stripe.
- **FR-004**: Upon successful payment, the system MUST update the user's account status to "active" and record the selected subscription plan.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle payment failures gracefully and provide clear feedback to the user.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Payment**: Represents a transaction processed by Stripe. The system will likely only need to handle the status of the payment (success/failure) and not store detailed payment information.
