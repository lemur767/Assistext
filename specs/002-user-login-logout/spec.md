## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a registered user, I want to securely log in to my account using my email and password to access my dashboard. I also want a clear way to log out when I am finished.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a registered user is on the login page, **When** they enter their correct email and password and click "Login", **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to their dashboard.
2. **Given** a registered user is on the login page, **When** they enter an incorrect email or password, **Then** an error message is displayed.
3. **Given** a logged-in user is on the dashboard, **When** they click the "Logout" button, **Then** their session is terminated and they are redirected to the login page.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a user tries to access a protected page (e.g., the dashboard) without being logged in? They should be redirected to the login page.
- What happens when a user's account is locked? The user should be presented with a message indicating the account is locked and should follow the instructions in the email sent to them.
