# Feature Specification: Outbound Message Sending

**Feature Branch**: `006-outbound-message-sending`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Final  
**Input**: User description: "Outbound Message Sending, as per Story 2.3 in PRD"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a backend developer, I want to send the AI-generated response as an SMS message via Signalwire, so that the end-user receives the AI's reply.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI response has been generated and saved, **When** the outbound sending process is triggered, **Then** the system makes a request to the Signalwire API to send an SMS.
2. **Given** the Signalwire API request is successful, **When** the message is sent, **Then** the system logs the successful delivery.
3. - **Given** the Signalwire API returns an error, **When** the message fails to send, **Then** the system will retry sending the message up to 3 times with a 25-second delay between each attempt. If all retries fail, the error is logged, and the user is alerted.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the recipient's number is invalid or cannot receive SMS? The system should handle the error from Signalwire and mark the message as failed.
- How does the system prevent sending duplicate messages if the process is triggered multiple times for the same response? The system should have idempotency checks in place.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST be able to make a request to the Signalwire API to send an SMS message.
- **FR-002**: The request MUST include the AI-generated response, the user's ghost number as the "from" number, and the end-user's number as the "to" number.
- **FR-003**: System MUST correctly handle success and error responses from the Signalwire API.
- **FR-004**: System MUST log the status of sent messages (e.g., submitted, sent, failed).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Outbound Message**: Represents an SMS message sent from the system. Attributes include the message content, sender, recipient, and delivery status.
