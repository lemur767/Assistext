## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a new user, I want to be able to choose between the Basic and Pro subscription plans during my trial period, so that I can select the plan that best fits my needs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the "Subscription" or "Billing" page, **When** they view the available plans, **Then** the features and pricing of the Basic and Pro tiers are clearly displayed.
2. **Given** a user is on the plan selection page, **When** they select a plan, **Then** the system registers their choice and proceeds to the payment step.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the pricing or features of the plans change? The system will fetch the latest plan information directly from Stripe to ensure it is always up-to-date.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Subscription" or "Billing" page accessible from the user settings.
- **FR-002**: The page MUST clearly display the features and pricing of the Basic and Pro subscription tiers by fetching the data directly from Stripe's product catalog.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow the user to select which plan they would like to subscribe to.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Subscription Plan**: Represents a subscription tier, managed as a Product in Stripe. Attributes include plan name (Basic/Pro), price, and a list of included features.
